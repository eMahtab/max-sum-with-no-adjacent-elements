# Max sum with no adjacent elements
Given an array of positive integers find the **maximum sum of non-adjacent elements** in the array. If a sum cannot be generated, return 0.

#### Note : We can not include two adjacent numbers.

**Example 1:**
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3 (include only the second number)

**Example 2:**
